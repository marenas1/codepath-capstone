## New App Ideas - Evaluate and Categorize
1. CodePath Cats 
   - **Description**: Have a tableview of cats displaying their name, and picture. On the detail screen it will have their age, birthday, shelter at which they are at. Randomize (Brooklyn, Queens, etc). Then in favorites tabs you can keep track of your favorite cats and see if they have been adopted or not.
   - **Category:** Buying?
   - **Mobile:** This could be used on both mobile or desktop. Nothing truly mobile specific here. Seems like a glorified website :(.
   - **Story:** Allows people looking for cats to be able to quickly find them and have access to data about them. Value is clear however I don't think my friends or peers would use this as they already have pets.
   - **Market:** Anyone looking to adopt a cat. Extremely niche and well defined audience.
   - **Habit:** People would probably check this about once a week or every couple of days.However once the goal of adopting a cat is acheived, the app would discarded as they no longer have use for it. It is a one and done type of app.
   - **Scope:** The app would probably only need one version for people to test and use. It is not very technically challening to complete this. The product is clearly defined.

   - **Category:** Social Networking/Photography
   - **Mobile:** Mobile is essential for the photos taken. Since users will need to go to a specific location, desktops will not be able to accomplish this task.The camera is used to share images with other users. Will be utilizing both maps and camera.
   - **Story:** Creates a community of like minded extroverted people who are into taking cool photographs. Allows people to share photos and make friends, additionally, the winner feels sense of accomplishment for having the most liked photo. I believe my friends and I would use and enjoy this app.
   - **Market:** Any individual could utilize this app. As long as they have a phone and are able to get to the location. The scale is large. Not neccessarily niche but I assume mostly teenagers and young adults would use this.
   - **Habit:** People are using this app daily as a new location is dropped each day and the liked leaderboard would reset daily. Very habit forming, users do not just consume, they create.
   - **Scope:** Base version would allow users to take pictures and post them to the board. V2 with filters would allow users to only get locations in their specific borough. V3 would add a friends tab. This would be technically challenging for the full app, people would have to check that pictures are valid and not offensive. Measures would have to be put in place to ensure locations are all public and safe. However a stripped down version seems interesting to build anyway. The product is clearly defined.
